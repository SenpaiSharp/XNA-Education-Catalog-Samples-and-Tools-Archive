# XNA Education Catalog Samples and Tools Archive
Archived zips from Microsoft's Education Catalog for XNA,  licensed under MS-PL.

These are provided as they were from xbox.create.msdn and with no warranty from Github, Microsoft or me. Almost none of them are pick up and compile. Most won't work right with modern Visual Studio versions. Many of them are meant for platforms and utilities long dead, including but not limited to: Xbox 360, Windows Phone and GFWL. Some of them are for versions of XNA older than 4.0 (Refresh). There are plenty of better ways to do almost everything covered within this material. The intent of this git is not in anyway to update everything to run on Monogame or FNA, it is strictly an archival project to fulfill those extreme, 3 in the morning, edge case needs. For that reason, I am providing them in their original zip formats and not as direct code. 

A copy of the MS-PL original license should be in all of the zips.
